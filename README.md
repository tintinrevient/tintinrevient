## Hi there! 👋

I'm Shu, an AI generalist passionate about open source and exploring the intersection of technology and design.

### 👀 Current Focus

I'm currently working on **[ProteinGym](https://github.com/ProteinGym)** - an open source benchmarking platform for evaluating machine learning models for proteins. This project is a combination of computational biology and machine learning applications in protein engineering, with [proteingym-base](https://github.com/ProteinGym/proteingym-base) to process data and models and [https://github.com/ProteinGym/proteingym-benchmark](proteingym-benchmark) to benchmark selected data and models.

### ✨ Open Source Projects

Here are some other projects I'm working on:

#### [Color Wheel](https://github.com/tintinrevient/color-wheel)
An interactive data visualization project exploring color theory and design principles using D3.js and Svelte.

**Tech Stack:** SvelteKit, D3.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.

#### [Mycorrhizal Network](https://github.com/tintinrevient/mycorrhizal-network)
A distributed network traffic analysis system that captures, traces, and visualizes network topology patterns using graph-based visualization, inspired by biological mycorrhizal networks. 

**Tech Stack**: Apache Kafka, ksqlDB, Kubernetes, Helm, Neo4j, Scapy, Neovis.

### [NOT Doing Excel](https://github.com/tintinrevient/not-doing-excel)
A data pipeline project demonstrating how to migrate from Excel-based workflows to a structured database system with interactive querying and visualization capabilities. 

**Tech Stack**: PostgreSQL, Apache Superset.

#### [Joints Data](https://github.com/tintinrevient/joints-data)
A computer vision research project analyzing human poses and body contours in classical and modern artwork using pose estimation and body segmentation techniques. 

**Tech Stack**: OpenPose, DensePose, COCO Dataset, AdaIN Style Transfer.
